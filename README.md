# About my Titanic-Prediction Model

This is my project for the Titanic Dataset. Where I Implement Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Goal is to build a model that predicts survivors. 

In the model I implemented cross validation techniques such as PCA and Recall-Precision Threshold for logistoc regression as well as RFECV for Random Forest.
